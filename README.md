# Pokémon Disco Yellow 

This project is a fork of The [Yellow Legacy]([https://github.com/cRz-Shadows/Pokemon_Crystal_Legacy]) project by TheSmithPlays(TSP).

## Philosophy & Direction

This project aims to leverage all of the QoL enhancements & other great work by the TSP team & collaborators to also include a more balanced Pokémon experience to highlight more often forgotten Pokémon, increasing the variety of them in a normal playthrough. This includes both improvements to their stats, learnsets, movepools, and most importantly availability. What this hack will (still) not do: add the Physical/Special Split or modern Dark/Fairy types.

As an additional QoL, I also believe no Pokémon should be exclusively available as a 1% catch.
